/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a public read policy for claims, allowing any user to view claim data, while restricting write access to only authenticated users. Patient data is also readable by anyone.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /claims/{claimId}: Stores individual claim records.
 * - /patients/{patientId}: Stores individual patient records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Claims are publicly readable to support open data access.
 * - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete claims.
 * - Patients are publicly readable to support open data access.
 * - Write access to patient data is denied.
